Directory names are corresponding to each method, for ex:
Mixture_audio: contains mixture files
auxiliary_information: contains the reference speech of target speaker which is used to obtain the speaker embeddings
ground_truth_target: contains the ground-truth target speaker files
baseline_processed: files processed using baseline method
Conformer-FFN_processed: files processed using Conformer-FFN based system
TCN-Conformer_processed: files processed using TCN-Conformer system

PNG files includes the CPU processing time and memory usage for each system.
